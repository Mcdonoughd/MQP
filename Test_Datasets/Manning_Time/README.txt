How to Read this Dataset:


Within the Manning_Simple dataset there is currently only one well; A1. This well is split into multiple XY coordinates but currently only XY1 is labeled for 14 timepoints (5 min separation). Whithin a XY coordinate there are folders for the Red and Green Channels and one with both (the Overlay folder). Within the Overlay folder, there are folders for each timepoint. Each timepoint contains the original .TIF file, a GIMP file, and a Masks Fodler. The Masks folder contains an image that isolates 1 cell and labeled with a color based on its health.

Red (ff0000)  	= no foci
Green (00ff00)	= foci
